abstract: "We introduce the VQualA 2025 Challenge on Face Image Quality Assessment, part of ICCV 2025 Workshops. Participants developed efficient models (<0.5 GFLOPs, <5M parameters) predicting Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) under realistic degradations. The challenge attracted 127 participants, resulting in 1519 valid final submissions, contributing to practical FIQA solutions."
