abstract: "We propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address limited contextual capacity and low predictability in traffic prediction. Our framework consists of three key designs: Decoupled Encoder and Query Generator, Spatio-temporal Retrieval Store and Retrievers, and Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained STGNNs or simple MLP predictors."
