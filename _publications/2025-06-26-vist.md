abstract: "We propose ViST, a novel vision-driven framework that transforms raw spatio-temporal data directly into a low-dimensional visual space for more effective and scalable forecasting. Our method features Multi-view Vision Transformation, Multi-modal Conditional Reconstruction, and Efficient Cross-modal Fusion Mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost."
