abstract: "We investigate the anchoring effect in Large Language Models, exploring whether LLMs are affected by anchoring bias, the underlying mechanisms, and potential mitigation strategies. We introduce SynAnchors dataset and show that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some mitigation."
