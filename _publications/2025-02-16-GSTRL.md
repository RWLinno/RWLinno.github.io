abstract: "Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of shared resources, including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet societal needs. However, existing allocation methods focus on optimizing the movement of individual resources independently, without considering their capacity constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly incorporates capacity constraints across multiple resources. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. GSTRL is composed of two steps: 1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a Cooperative Potential Game and derive a reward learning rule based on the potential function, laying a solid theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium; and 2) GSTRL incorporates a spatio-temporal learning module that effectively captures dynamic crowd flow distribution. We evaluate GSTRL on two real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines and highlight the key components' impact on learning effectiveness."
