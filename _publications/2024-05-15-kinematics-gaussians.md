abstract: "In this paper, we address the challenge of actor-level object reconstruction and articulation simulation for articulated objects. Previous approaches mainly rely on implicit-based models for reconstructing such objects, which have significantly advanced the perception of their structure but suffer from limited extrapolation capabilities and subpar reconstruction quality. In contrast, we introduce Gaussian Splatting, an innovative representation that employs distributed 3D Gaussians across object surfaces, enabling precise object reconstruction. Our method leverages the inherent joint properties to articulate actors, thereby enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and extrapolation ability. Furthermore, we integrate kinematic knowledge with Gaussian Splatting to model the articulation of objects. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only accurately reproduces the geometric details of objects but also captures their articulation dynamics with high fidelity."
