|                      | Status     | Comment                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Celeste              | NG+        | Best platform jumping game in my mind.                       |
| Dark Soul Ⅲ          | NG+        | Best Hidetaka Miyazaki                                       |
| Hollow Knight        | NG+        | Looking forward to the sequel.                               |
| CupHead              | NG+        | I like to play with my girlfriend very much and have a sense of achievement. |
| Breath of the Wild   | Exploring  | I'm not willing to fight the boss yet                        |
| Tears of the Kingdom | Exploring  | Open but not very friendly in the beginning.                 |
| Pokémon Violet       | Clear      | Pokemon deserves better.                                     |
| GRIS                 | Clear      | As a game, it lacks; as a work of art, it deserves.          |
| Inside               | Clear      | It's worth several hours of your time.                       |
| Katana Zero          | Clear      | Very Cool Game.                                              |
| Cyberpunk2077        | Unfinished | Maybe it needs to continue to be optimised while I play.     |
| Genshin Impact       | Level Full | Games for retirement.                                        |



## Game Development

I Have published **4**  Indie games on online game platforms, which improved my engineering and programming skills. If you're interested, feel free to try my representative work "**Orphan of the Petal**" on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/975050/Orphan_of_the_Petal/



## Knowledge Sharing

I enjoy using the CSDN blog for ACM-related knowledge sharing, which recorded my learning experience.
