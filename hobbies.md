|                      | Status     | Comment                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Celeste              | NG+        | Best platform jumping game in my mind.                       |
| Dark Soul Ⅲ          | NG+        | Best Hidetaka Miyazaki                                       |
| Hollow Knight        | NG+        | Looking forward to the sequel.                               |
| CupHead              | NG+        | I like to play with my girlfriend very much and have a sense of achievement. |
| Breath of the Wild   | NG+        | I didn't will to fight the boss once, think of it as a casual game now. |
| Tears of the Kingdom | Exploring  | Open but not very friendly in the beginning.                 |
| Super Mario Odyssey  | Exploring  | It's better to play with VR and somatosensory.               |
| Pokémon Violet       | Clear      | Pokemon deserves better.                                     |
| GRIS                 | Clear      | As a game, it lacks; as a work of art, it deserves.          |
| Inside               | Clear      | It's worth several hours of your time.                       |
| Little Nightmares Ⅱ  | clear      | The most beautiful horror game I've ever seen                |
| Katana Zero          | Clear      | Very Cool Game.                                              |
| Metroid Dread        | Clear      | The most expensive game I have played.                       |
| Cyberpunk2077        | Unfinished | Maybe it needs to continue to be optimized when I played.    |
| Genshin Impact       | Level Full | Games for retirement.                                        |
